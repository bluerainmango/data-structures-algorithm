//* If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
//? => Breadth First Search(BFS)

//* If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// DFS will take too long
//? => Breadth First Search(BFS)

//* If the tree is very wide:
// BFS will need too much memory
//? => Depth First Search(DFS)

//* If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
//? => Depth First Search(DFS)

//* Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
//? => Depth First Search(DFS)

//* Finding the shortest path:
//? => Breadth First Search(BFS)
